# A Dance Of Fire And Ice Ver 2.1.0 Package

We try to make editor running on mobile so we start this project.

Also 7th Beat think they can't make editor on mobile...

The "We" means two students. (And their English is very poor)

Our programming skills are not very good (Unity is even more), I hope everyone can help us to correct the code.

This is my first time upload project on Github.
